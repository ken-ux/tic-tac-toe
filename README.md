# tic-tac-toe

This is a browser game that simulates playing tic-tac-toe against a computer. Messages below the game board tell the user whether a space is already occupied, the winner of each game, or whether it's a tie. The emphasis of this project is the use of factory functions and IIFEs to practice closures and encapsulation.
